# generator-owin-static [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/olohmann/generator-owin-static.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/olohmann/generator-owin-static)

> A [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator to create a minimal [OWIN](http://owin.org/)-based .NET Web application with its NuGet dependencies, project and solution files.

The server uses the OWIN host package and the static file handler middleware instead of IIS Express. The purpose of this tiny project template is to have a quick start for doing demos and samples of static web applications in Visual Studio. 

### Installation

To install generator-owin-static from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-owin-static
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo owin-static
```
